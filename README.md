IW4 Weapon Definitions Editor.
Made by @kurayvmi

There are plenty tools out there already to edit
weapon defs like this one... I wanted to get some
CSharp practice in and decided to start here. 

Available to change models, anims, and state timings
for IW4 formatted weapon def files. Does not include
sound or any extras yet. Just the base to speed up my
workflow.
